# Portfolio | Any Buss

Hello! This project shows some features that I had learned in HTML, CSS and JS courses.

I have decided to start from my website because that way I can show you what  I've been learning and also I can have my website as my own portfolio.
The idea here is to have an initial project and, at the same time, my main project. It will always be updated with new functions that I`ve been learning (HTML & CSS) as programming languages & frameworks.
